# Quick data access

Use the following datasets to explore morphological similarities between gene and/or compounds.

| Dataset  | Matches                                    | Feature ranking                                       | Gallery                                                         | Description         |
|-------- |------------------------------------------ |----------------------------------------------------- |--------------------------------------------------------------- |------------------- |
| ORF      | [broad.io/orf](https://broad.io/orf)       | [broad.io/orf\_feature](https://broad.io/orf_feature) | [broad.io/orf\_gallery](https://broad.io/orf_gallery)           | Gene overexpression |
| CRISPR   | [broad.io/crispr](https://broad.io/crispr) | [broad.io/crispr\_feature](https://broad.io/crispr)   | [broad.io/crispr\_gallery](https://broad.io/crispr_gallery)     | Gene knock-out      |
| Compound | WIP                                        | WIP                                                   | [broad.io/compound\_gallery](https://broad.io/compound_gallery) | Chemical compounds  |

Note that the feature databases are based on interpretable features. The The perturbation databases use non-interpretable features, which have been processed to attenuate batch effects.

# Overview

This module provides tools to efficiently compare vectors of [JUMP](https://jump-cellpainting.broadinstitute.org/) data. It also assembles the dataframes that we make accessible through the browser using [datasette-lite](https://github.com/simonw/datasette-lite). You can read more about JUMP at the [JUMP Cellpainting Hub](https://broad.io/jump).


<a id="Data%20accessibility"></a>

# Data accessibility

-   You can fetch the raw morphological profiles (before any non-image processing step) on the [Cell Painting Gallery](https://cellpainting-gallery.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#cpg0016-jump-assembled/source_all/workspace/profiles) (CPG) under the &ldquo;profiles.parquet&rdquo; names.
-   [This](https://github.com/broadinstitute/monorepo/tree/452543be5f17a626a3964b8b90984a9502952a06/libs/jump_rr/tools/download_profiles.org) file points to the gist points to the data used to produce the final tables, if you adjust `OUTPUT_DIR` you can download the files locally.


<a id="Installation"></a>

# Installation

You do not need to install this unless you want to re-do the similarity calculations. You can use the datasette web interface provided if your goal is to explore genes. We assume that a GPU and cuda11 are available in the server where this is run. This is to use cupy, which offers vastly faster distance calculations.


<a id="pip"></a>

## pip

Use this if you want to re-analyse data. Several of the anyalyses require GPUs.

```python
pip install jump_rr
```


<a id="poetry%20%28dev%29"></a>

## poetry (dev)

Use this if you want to tweak the functions

```python
git clone https://github.com/broadinstitute/monorepo/
cd monorepo/libs/jump_rr
poetry install --with dev
```
