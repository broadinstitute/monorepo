                        "Feature significance": "Adjusted p-value (*) indicating the statistical significance of the difference between a specific morphological feature in the perturbed condition compared to the control condition. Lower values suggest a stronger effect of the perturbation on that particular feature.",
                        "Gene/Compound": "Chemical or genetic perturbation. If genetic (overexpression or knock-out) it is the NCBI gene symbol. If it is a chemical perturbation this is the InChiKey. ",

                        "Corrected p-value": "Statistical significance of how distinctive a perturbation is relative to the negative control. It is negatively correlated to mean average precision, but adjusted based on its composition of positive and negative values.",
                        "Phenotypic activity": "Mean average precision of the matched perturbation. It determines how different a perturbation is relative to the negative control. An empty value indicates that the value was discarded due to low infection efficiency.",
