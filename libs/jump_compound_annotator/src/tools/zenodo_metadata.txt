Supplementary Data for MOTIVE: Drug-Target Interaction Annotations

OVERVIEW

Supplementary material for Arevalo, Su et al., NeurIPS 2024 - a drug-target interaction graph dataset combining annotations from 8 public databases with Cell Painting image features.

The processed MOTIVE dataset is on the Cell Painting Gallery S3 bucket. This Zenodo deposit provides raw annotation pipeline outputs including ID mapping infrastructure and original database downloads.

Note: Row counts may differ slightly from S3 annotations due to database updates since original 2024-06 run.


DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

- annotations/ - Drug-target interaction parquet files
- mappings/ - ID mapping files (pointers.csv, UniChem/MyChem mappers)
- intermediate/ - Compressed UniChem API query outputs
- raw_sources/ - Compressed raw database downloads


ANNOTATIONS

Drug-target annotations from 8 databases: BioKG, DGIdb, DrugRep, Hetionet, OpenBioLink, OpenTargets, PharmeBiNet, PrimeKG

- compound_gene.parquet - Drug-gene annotations
- gene_gene.parquet - Gene-gene interactions
- compound_compound.parquet - Drug-drug interactions
- compound_gene_curated.parquet - Curated drug-gene (standardized rel_types, hub compounds removed)

MAPPINGS

- pointers.csv - UniChem mappings (InChIKey to DrugBank/ChEMBL/PubChem)
- unichem_*_mapper.parquet - InChIKey resolution via UniChem API
