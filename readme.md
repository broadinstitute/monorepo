## JUMP Information Central

JUMP Cell Painting is one of our main projects, it is the creation of a data-driven approach to drug discovery based on cellular imaging, image analysis, and high dimensional data analytics You can find general information [here](https://jump-cellpainting.broadinstitute.org/), and details on how to make use of it [here](https://broad.io/jump).
