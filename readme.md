Monorepo of the Carpenter-Singh Lab, hosting many of the tools and methods we develop and use.

## Tools

### Libraries

- [broad\_babel](https://github.com/broadinstitute/monorepo/tree/main/libs/jump_babel): Translate gene names to and from broad and JUMP ids, NCBI and other identifiers.
- [jump\_compound\_annotator](https://github.com/broadinstitute/monorepo/tree/main/libs/jump_compound_annotator): Collect compound names and relationships from multiple online databases using their APIs or web requests.
- [jump\_portrait](https://github.com/broadinstitute/monorepo/tree/main/libs/jump_portrait): Fetch JUMP images from CellPainting&rsquo;s AWS servers. It also contains some utilities to explore file names.
- [jump\_rr](https://github.com/broadinstitute/monorepo/tree/main/libs/jump_rr): Generate browsable databases of perturbation similarities and morphological feature rankings to be explored and queried on a browser.
- [trommel](https://github.com/broadinstitute/monorepo/tree/main/libs/trommel): Data-cleaning functions and pipelines to improve the signal of morphological profiles.
-  [jump\_smiles](https://github.com/broadinstitute/monorepo/tree/swb/libs/smiles): Standardiser of (Chemical) SMILES.

### Tools outside the monorepo

-   [copairs](https://github.com/broadinstitute/2023_12_JUMP_data_only_vignettes/tree/master): Find pairs and compute metrics between them.
- [[cp\_measure](https://github.com/afermg/cp_measurements)]: Extract CellProfiler features directly from Python.

## JUMP Cell Painting Hub

JUMP Cell Painting is one of our main projects, it is the creation of a data-driven approach to drug discovery based on cellular imaging, image analysis, and high dimensional data analytics You can find most information at the [JUMP Cell Painting Hub](https://broad.io/jump).
